We don't have anything but happy trees here. Let's do that again. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun The least little bit can do so much. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. These trees are so much fun.

I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. We'll play with clouds today. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun The least little bit can do so much.

					<div class="content__text">So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun The least little bit can do so much. Work on one thing at a time.
